# Word-Guess-Game

# This app is a game that picks a random word from a pre-defined list of words.

# You start the game by pressing any key on the computer, and blank lines appear that match the number of characters in the random word.

# The user is supposed to guess each letter and with each right guess, the blank lines are filled with the letter(s). With each wrong guess, the amount of guesses the user has decreases by 1.

# If you get the word before your guesses gets to 0, then you win, and the game restarts. If not, you lose, and the game restarts
